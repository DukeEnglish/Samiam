# Samiam-case-net
The interesting case I created for fun using samiam

Offer_or_not: is a kind of interviewer who can decide whether you could get a offer. However I have no enough data and experience, so the results is prejustice. I probablyÂ modify it later when I have data or someone (e.g. HR) could help me ^0^.
